## Example

Stadiums Results: At first glance, the number of sports stadiums opened
vary greatly for each major city, except Phoenix most likely due to most stadiums 
being outside of the city itself

The csv is generated in the proper format, however,
allowing for more in-depth visualization and analysis. 

## Important Notes:

**NOTE 1:** Adding state column since there can be more than
one city with the same name
Ex: Manhattan, NY vs. Manhattan, KS
